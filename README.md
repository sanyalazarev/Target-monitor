# Trafic-monitor
Traffic monitoring system on Node.js

How does it work?
You pass traffic through this system. It defines the user and redirects him to the desired address. You collect analytics and determine the actions that a particular user has performed.

For example, you send a client to:
https://traficmonitor.com/monit?offer_id=1&affiliate_id=1&creative_id=1
and then redirected:
https://yoursite.com
Thanks to this redirection, the system identifies the user and collects statistics.
